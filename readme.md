I redid the d3 chart instead of using the old one. I was not able to figure out the advanced labels in time, as the code we were sent is a bit outdated for the current d3 (it was written in 2014) and half of the code was made for a visual transition and not the actual drawing of the graph. In my Visual Analytics class I will likely learn to do this advanced method, but for this assignment I ran out of time.
