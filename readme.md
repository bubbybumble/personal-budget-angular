I redid the d3 chart instead of using the old one. I was not able to figure out the advanced labels in time, as the code we were sent is a bit outdated for the current d3 (it was written in 2014) and half of the code was made for a visual transition and not the actual drawing of the graph. In my Visual Analytics class I will likely learn to do this advanced method, but for this assignment I ran out of time.

I also had issues with the CSS we copy/pasted over. In the tutorial, the professor had different classnames for his components, and I could not find in the CSS what was controlling the grid layout. I at least got most of the basic visuals to work properly, but I am sorry I couldn't get the grid layout to work.
